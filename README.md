# Metacognition-and-Drowsiness
This repository was created as support for a poster presented at the ASSC2022. It contains a pdf subdivided into two sections:

1) The Results section contains additional figures and comments. The implications of the results are also briefly discussed.

2) The Next steps section gathers future directions the authors are considering â€” your input is very welcome!

Note also that this project was preregistered on OSF. You can have a look at our two preregistration documents here: https://osf.io/5q9wb/
