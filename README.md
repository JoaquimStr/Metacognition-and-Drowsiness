# Metacognition-and-Drowsiness
This repository was created for a poster presented at the ASSC2022. It contains three documents:

1) The Results documents contains all results, displayed on the poster or not, with some additional information.

2) The Discussion document gathers the implications from these results.

3) The Next steps document goes over future directions the authors are considering â€” your input is very welcome!

Note also that this project was preregistered on OSF. You can have a look at our two preregistration documents here: https://osf.io/5q9wb/
